jetty-rackup
============

For the newer projects we decided to switch from MRI to JRuby.  One of
the bigger questions is certainly the deployment.

Reading and trying all the warbler stuff, we had enough of packaging and
wanted to do it the Ruby/Sinatra way (with a standalone script, where
one can consciously start things like `run Sinatra::Application` from a
rackup script).

Embedding jetty is also mentioned in the jetty documentation "For many
applications, HTTP is just another interface protocol.  Jetty can easily
be embedded in such applications and products without adopting a WWW
centric application architecture."

So here is the solution:

* write your Rack based application as usual
* create a rackup script `config.ru` as usual; there is more information in
  the official tutorial
  <http://wiki.github.com/rack/rack/tutorial-rackup-howto>
* install jetty-rackup (this project), e.g. 
  `git clone git://github.com/geekq/jetty-rackup.git`
* from your application folder run `jetty-rackup`. You can also provide
  a path to non-standard rackup-script and the desired port
  number for the server to run.

Now your application runs inside jetty servlet container. Enjoy!


Example
-------
    $cat config.ru

    #\ -p 8765
    require 'rubygems'
    gem 'sinatra', '~> 0.9.4'
    require './my_app.rb'
    set :run, false # disable built-in sinatra web server
    set :environment, :development
    set :base_url, 'http://xxtrial' # custom application option
    run Sinatra::Application


Binaries
--------
The jetty and jruby-rack binaries are now provided for your convinience.
But you can also download a different version of them, if you wish, from
the official web sites of the respective projects:

* <http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/>
* <http://kenai.com/projects/jruby-rack/pages/Home>

The major gem version (7) now matches the used jetty version.
